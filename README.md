Simple RESTful API built with ASP.NET 5 to show how to create RESTful services using a decoupled, maintainable architecture.

## Changes list

Some changes were made to the code presented at the tutorial published on [Medium](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/an-awesome-guide-on-how-to-build-restful-apis-with-asp-net-core-87b818123e28) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-awesome-guide-on-how-to-build-restful-apis-with-asp-net-core-87b818123e28/), to make the API code cleaner and to add functionalities that developers may find useful.

  - First version of the example API, presented in the tutorial on [Medium](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/an-awesome-guide-on-how-to-build-restful-apis-with-asp-net-core-87b818123e28) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-awesome-guide-on-how-to-build-restful-apis-with-asp-net-core-87b818123e28/).

## Frameworks and Libraries
- [ASP.NET 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0);
- [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) (for data access);
- [Entity Framework In-Memory Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/testing/in-memory) (for testing purposes);
- [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) (for mapping resources and models);
- [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle) (API documentation).

## How to Test

First, install [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0). Then, open the terminal or command prompt at the API root path (```/src/Supermarket.API/```) and run the following commands, in sequence:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Navigate to ```https://localhost:5001/api/categories``` to check if the API is working. If you see a HTTPS security error, just add an exception to see the results.

Navigate to ```https://localhost:5001/swagger``` to check the API documentation and to test all API endpoints.
